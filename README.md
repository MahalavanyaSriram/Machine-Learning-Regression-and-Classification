# Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification
The analysis of datasets using different regression and classification algorithms with different complexity is covered by this repository. The analysis is done using Ipython Notebooks in Python (.ipynb files).

## Regression
Regression is a mathematical measure that seeks to assess the intensity of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a variety of other changing variables in economics, investment and other fields (known as independent variables).

## Classification
A Classification Algorithm is a method for choosing a class from a set of alternatives that fits a set of observations better. An example will be to determine whether a consumer would purchase a specific product or not use the consumers' different buying patterns or apply a disease diagnosis to a particular patient as defined by the patient's observed characteristics (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).

## Install
This repository requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Run
Download the required notebooks. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory(that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
`ipython notebook notebookname.ipynb`
or
`jupyter notebook notebookname.ipynb`

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## Data
The data files may required to be downloaded through the source links provided in the notebook and saved in the same Directory as the notebook file
